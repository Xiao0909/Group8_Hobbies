                        Hello! My name is Andrew Glanz and I'm a third year I.T. Student. I was responsible for the UI
                        and Design of this website. In my freetime, I like to listen to music and play video games.

                        My name is Rahul Shakya and I'm a junior doing IT-SD . I love playing basketball. I started
                        playing basketball because it helped me recover from an injury and it's been stuck with me as my
                        support system.

                        <p>My name is Xiao Xiao. I am graduating in April 2022. My major is Information Technology, and I
                        also have a certification in Game Art Design. Watching animation is one of my favorite thing to
                        do during my free time. I also took some animation-related classes during my school years. So I
                        picked the anime topic for the project.</p>
