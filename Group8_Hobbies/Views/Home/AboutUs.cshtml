                        Hello! My name is Andrew Glanz and I'm a third year I.T. Student. I was responsible for the UI
                        and Design of this website. In my freetime, I like to listen to music and play video games.

                        <h3>Rahul Shakya </h3>
                        My name is Rahul Shakya and I'm a junior doing IT-SD . I love playing basketball. I started
                        playing basketball because it helped me recover from an injury and it's been stuck with me as my
                        support system.

                        My name is Justin Tracy. I am a fourth year IT student at UC on the software development track.
                        In my free time I like to go for runs and play the bass guitar.

                        My name is Xiao Xiao. I am graduating in April 2022. My major is Information Technology, and I
                        also have a certification in Game Art Design. Watching animation is one of my favorite thing to
                        do during my free time. I also took some animation-related classes during my school years. So I
                        picked the anime topic for the project.

                        My name is Chris Royce. I'm a junior with my primary track being Software Development and a secondary track in Game Design. I chose games as my hobby because that's what I do in my free time, and it has helped bring me closer to friends and family.
